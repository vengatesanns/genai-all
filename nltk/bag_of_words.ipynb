Actually,\\nI am  bit puzzled too and a bit relieved. However, I am going to put an end\\nto non-PIttsburghers' relief with a bit of praise for the Pens. Man, they\\nare killing those Devils worse than I thought. Jagr just showed you why\\nhe is much better than his regular season stats. He is also a lot\\nfo fun to watch in the playoffs. Bowman should let JAgr have a lot of\\nfun in the next couple of games since the Pens are going to beat the pulp out of Jersey anyway. I was very disappointed not to see the Islanders lose the final\\nregular season game.

This frees the\\nSCSI bus for other devices. This is typically used in a multi-tasking OS to\\nstart transfers on several devices. While each device is seeking the data the\\nbus is free for other commands and data transfers. When the devices are\\nready to transfer the data they can aquire the bus and send the data.\\n\\nOn an IDE bus when you start a transfer the bus is busy until the disk has seeked\\nthe data and transfered it. This is typically a 10-20ms second lock out for other\\nprocesses wanting the bus irrespective of transfer time.\\n\\n> \\n> Also, I\\'m still trying to track down a copy of IBM\\'s AT reference book,\\n> but from their PC technical manual (page 2-93):\\n> \\n> \"The (FDD) adapter is buffered on the I.O bus and uses the System Board\\n> direct memory access (DMA) for record data transfers.\"\\n> I expect to see something similar for the PC-AT HDD adapter.  \\n> So the lowly low-density original PC FDD card used DMA and the PC-AT\\n> HDD controller doesn\\'t!?!?
